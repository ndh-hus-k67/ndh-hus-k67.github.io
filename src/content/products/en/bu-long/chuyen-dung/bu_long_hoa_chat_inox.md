    Stainless steel chemical anchor bolts use injection adhesive to fix bolts/rods into concrete or stone.
    With stainless materials (typically SUS304/SUS316/SUS316L), they are suitable for humid, coastal, or chemically aggressive environments.

    Common applications include column bases, machine foundations, steel structures, brackets, and railings where high bond strength and reliability are required.

    A chemical anchor consists of a bolt/rod and an injection adhesive. When installed properly, the adhesive fills the drilled hole and creates a strong bond.

    Stainless steel makes this solution ideal for high-humidity or corrosive environments, increasing service life.
