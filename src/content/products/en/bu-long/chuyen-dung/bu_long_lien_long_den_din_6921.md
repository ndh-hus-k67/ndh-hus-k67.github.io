    DIN 6921 stainless flange bolts feature a hex head with an integrated flange beneath the head.

    The flange increases bearing area, improves load distribution, and helps prevent loosening in certain applications. The shank is typically metric threaded (often fully threaded).

  title: "DIN 6921 – Integrated Flange Bolt for Stable Joints"
  subTitle: |
    DIN 6921 bolts consist of a hex head for wrenching and a threaded shank. The integrated flange increases bearing area and helps reduce surface indentation compared to standard bolts (depending on base material).

    Materials include SS201/304/316/316L or steel depending on corrosion resistance and load requirements. For steel, strength classes can follow ISO 898-1 (subject to batch/standard).
