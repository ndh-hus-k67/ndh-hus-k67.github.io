    Eyebolts have a circular eye integrated with the bolt shank.
    They are suitable for anchoring, lifting, or creating a connection point for moving or holding components and equipment.

    DIN 444-B eyebolts are commonly made from stainless steel (201/304/316/316L) for corrosion resistance, and can also be manufactured in other materials depending on load and environment.
