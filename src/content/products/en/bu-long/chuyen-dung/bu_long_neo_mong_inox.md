    Stainless steel anchor bolts are used to connect column bases, machine bases, or steel structures to concrete foundations.

    They typically feature a metric threaded shank and a bent tail formed per drawings (I, L, J, U, V, LA, JA, etc.). Stainless materials make them ideal for high corrosion resistance requirements.
