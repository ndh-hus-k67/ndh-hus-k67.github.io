    Stainless expansion bolts (sleeve anchors) feature an expansion sleeve around the shank.
    When the nut is tightened, the sleeve expands and grips the base material (typically concrete or steel structures), increasing holding strength and load capacity.

    Materials can be SS201/304/316/316L or steel, depending on environment and cost requirements.

  title: "Durable Stainless Expansion Anchors"
  subTitle: |
    Stainless expansion bolts are widely used for secure anchoring thanks to the expanding sleeve mechanism, ideal for installations requiring high stability.

    Material selection balances cost and corrosion resistance: SS201 for dry environments, SS304 for general use, SS316/316L for humid, chemical, or coastal environments.
