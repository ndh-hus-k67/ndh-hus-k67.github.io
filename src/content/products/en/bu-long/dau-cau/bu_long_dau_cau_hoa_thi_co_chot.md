    Security button head TORX+PIN bolts (hexalobular socket with pin) are tamper-resistant fasteners.

    The pin-in-TORX drive prevents use of standard screwdrivers. These are used in high-security locations to deter unauthorized removal. Due to the specialized head machining, costs can be higher than standard screws.
