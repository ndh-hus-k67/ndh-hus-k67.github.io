    DIN 7991 countersunk socket head bolts have a conical head that sits nearly flush with the surface after installation.

    The head has an internal hex socket for tightening with a hex key. Threads follow DIN 7991, commonly fully threaded (depending on size/order).

longDescription:
  title: "DIN 7991 – Countersunk Head for Flush Surfaces"
  subTitle: |
    DIN 7991 bolts leave a clean, flush surface, ideal for assemblies where appearance matters or interference must be avoided.

    Materials include SS201/304/316/316L or steel depending on environment. Steel typically uses strength classes 8.8/10.9 (reference), while stainless is chosen for corrosion resistance.
