    DIN 931 partially threaded hex bolts have a hex head and a smooth shank with partial threading.
    They are used in mechanical assemblies and structures where a smooth shank improves alignment and shear performance.

    Choose SS201/304/316/316L for corrosion resistance or steel for cost optimization.
